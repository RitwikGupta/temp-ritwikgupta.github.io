This is a page for my talk given at [FCHacks 2017](http://fchacks.io) at Fox Chapel High School on March 25th, 2017. I will add more detail here after the hackathon!

## Data
Get the data from [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/data/dr.csv) (right click, save as).

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.5.X

## Setup
* Open your terminal/command prompt.
* Verify Python 3.5.X is installed by running `python -V` (or `python3 -V` for systems where Python is alt-installed).
* Install the following packages via `pip` (By running `pip install package-name`):
  * ipython[all]
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * scikit-learn

## Slides
These aren't too helpful as the majority of this talk was interactive, but I will post my iPython notebook and writeup here soon.  
If you're on mobile, view the slides [here]({{ site.url}}/assets/fchacks-dr-2017.pdf).
